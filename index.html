                <h2>Excerpt from the life of a stupid man - Ryunosuke Akutagawa</h2>
                <p align="justify">
                    That is true, Your Honor. I am the one who found the body. I went out as
                    usual this morning to cut cedar in the hills behind my place. The body was
                    in a bamboo grove on the other side of the mountain. Its exact location? A
                    few hundred yards off the Yamashina post road. A deserted place where a
                    few scrub cedar trees are mixed in with the bamboo.
                    The man was lying on his back in his pale blue robe with the sleeves tied
                    up and one of those fancy Kyoto-style black hats with the sharp creases. He
                    had only one stab wound, but it was right in the middle of his chest; the
                    bamboo leaves around the body were soaked with dark red blood. No, the
                    bleeding had stopped. The wound looked dry, and I remember it had a big
                    horsefly sucking on it so hard the thing didn't even notice my footsteps.
                    Did I see a sword or anything? No, Sir, not a thing. Just a length of rope
                    by the cedar tree next to the body. And oh yes, there was a comb there,
                    too. Just the rope and the comb is all. But the weeds and the bamboo leaves
                    on the ground were pretty trampled down: he must have put up a
                    tremendous fight before they killed him. How's that, Sir - a horse? No, a
                    horse could never have gotten into that place. It's all bamboo thicket
                    between there and the road.
                    THE TESTIMONY OF A TRAVELING PRIEST UNDER QUESTIONING BY THE
                    MAGISTRATE 
                    I'm sure I passed the man yesterday, Your Honor. Yesterday at about
                    noon, I'd say. Near Checkpoint Hill on the way to Yamashina. He was
                    walking toward the checkpoint with a woman on horseback. She wore a
                    stiff, round straw hat with a long veil hanging down around the brim; I
                    couldn't see her face, just her robe. I think it had a kind of dark-red outer
                    layer with a blue-green lining. The horse was a dappled gray with a tinge of
                    red, and I'm fairly sure it had a clipped mane. Was it a big horse? I'd say it
                    was a few inches taller than most, but I'm a priest after all. I don't know
                    much about horses. The man? No, Sir, he had a good-sized sword, and he
                    was equipped with a bow and arrows. I can still see that black-lacquered
                    quiver of his: he must have had twenty arrows in it, maybe more. I would
                    never have dreamt that a thing like this could happen to such a man.

                <h2 align = "center">Article About Four Byte Burger</h2>
                <p>
                    The magazine's deep dive into the Amiga <a href = "https://bytecellar.com/media/Personal_Computing_1985-Amiga.pdf">(take a look for yourself)</a> 
                    featured various examples of graphics created on the system,the most impressive of which to my eye was entitled 
                    <i>Four-Byte Burger</i> a whimsical and lovely, exploded digital painting 
                    of a floppy-disk cheeseburger of sorts created by Jack Haeger, Director of Amiga's Art and Graphics Department at the time. 
                    The 32-color image utilized the Amiga's 4096-color palette to produce graphics the likes of which I had never seen before. 
                    (At the time, I was using an Apple II that was 6-colors only, basically.) A short time later the premier issue of AmigaWorld 
                    magazine appeared on the shelf, also featuring the image within, and finally after the launch of the system, <i>Four-Byte Burger</i> 
                    made its way to the inner covers of the Graphicraft paint program's user manual which is the source of the high-res scan I was 
                    able to secure a few years back.Around the time of that earlier post, I tried to track down a digital copy of the image, but to no avail. 
                    It wasn't in the Amiga Graphics Archive, or seemingly anywhere else I looked. I came to find out that <i>Four-Byte Burger</i> along with 
                    several other early Amiga paintings featured in these magazines, were created with a version of Graphicraft so early in development 
                    that it did not yet feature file I/O capabilities. These images were drawn, the CRT display was photographed, and then those lovely 
                    pixels were cast into the void when power was taken from system RAM with the flick of a switch.
                    These images, in digital form at least, were lost to time...like tears in rain.
                    <br><br>
                    Luckily, I wasn't the only one that had been carrying that image around in his head for the past 40 years or so. Stuart Brown, YouTuber 
                    XboxAhoy who is renowned in gamer circles, recently posted to his video game documentary channel a video in which he laments the loss of 
                    this memorable image and sets out to recreate it based on the photographs we have available. This digital restoration was an arduous process, 
                    and it is fully documented by the benevolent restorer in his video. And, in the end, I believe he achieved his goal. The results bring an 
                    enormous smile to my face.Once I watched this amazing video, I immediately knew that I had to get this piece of digital artistry that's so 
                    beloved to me onto the glowing phosphor screen of my Amiga 1000. Ahoy was kind enough to provide a link to the resulting Amiga IFF image 
                    file when asked, so I loaded it onto the Parceiro device's SD card and after waiting for the 1080 monitor to degauss post-rotation 
                    (I encountered the same obscured color due to the Earth's magnetic field that he did in his video), I beheld an incredible sight indeed: 
                    an Amiga 1000 displaying its very best image - and on my desk - in the Byte Cellar.
                    Thanks, Ahoy.<br>
